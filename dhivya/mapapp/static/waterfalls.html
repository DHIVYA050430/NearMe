    It sounds like you're referring to a type of waterfall feature in a garden or landscape design where water cascades from a cup-shaped structure into a saucer-shaped basin below. These features add a tranquil and visually appealing element to outdoor spaces. They can be made from various materials like stone, ceramic, or even metal, and often incorporate pumps to circulate the water.
